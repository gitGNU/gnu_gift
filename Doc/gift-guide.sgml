      <p>
Caveat: THIS PROGRAM NEEDS MORE PREREQUISITES THAN OTHER GNU
PACKAGES (see below). At present, it installs neither info files
nor man pages. However, otherwise the install procedure 
tries to be GNU conformant. 
</p>
      <p>
GIFT is a content based image retrieval system (CBIRS). It gives
the user the possibility to index and search images without having 
to annotate them first. Indexing is done using image properties such 
as color and texture. 
</p>
      <p>
The query is one or multiple image <em>examples</em>.
</p>
      <p>
Content based image retrieval (CBIRS) is presently an area of vivid
research interest, yielding many different systems. 
</p>
      <p>
Our system is different from other systems with respect to the indexing
method. We use very many very simple features which are translated into 
some kind of "pseudo text" for each image. On this representation we use 
inverted files as indexing technique. In our opinion this representation 
has two great advantages:
<itemize>
	  <item>The representation is very flexible, in that it allows
good incorporation of relevance feedback. </item>
	  <item>The representation is very flexible, in that it will
allow completely integrated treatment of text (ASCII, HTML etc.) and
images. 
</item>
	</itemize>

both at a reasonable speed, which we hope to increase further. The
current implementation still leaves room for optimization.
</p>
      <p>
This document will be the user's guide to the GIFT content 
based image retrieval system. It is aimed at the user of such a system. 
Its companion document will be a programmer's manual elaborating details of 
interfacing etc. and a document describing the communication protocol, 
MRML, which we use for the communication between the user interface and
the image retrieval system.
</p>
      <p>

    <sect>
      <heading>MRML - Why we publish GIFT this way</heading>
      <p>
One big problem of CBIRS research is the non-existence of a common benchmark,
measuring the quality of retrieval results. In our project we have both worked 
on reasonable measures for benchmarks, and on software for performing this.
A precondition for a common benchmark is a common interface (in the
programming sense of the word), permitting
the connection of the benchmarking program to the benchmarked program. 
MRML is an XML based language providing such an interface.
</p>
      <p>
The other great effect of such an interface language is the possibility to
create GUIs for CBIRS which can be used by all MRML compliant servers.
Charmer provided by our partners at EPFL (contact details in the Author
field) is a very beautiful interface which will equally become free software.
</p>
      <p>
We (EPFLausanne and CUI, Geneva) provide this software with the goal
of promoting the use of MRML. Wide-spread use of MRML could both help
scientists (less work and easier exchange) and normal users (easy
combination of software packages from different sources. Think, for
example, of a GIMP plug-in which would help the user organize his images). 
</p>
      <p>
In fact, the idea of having interested real-world users test a system
like ours is very attractive, as data about real users are hard to
get. We hope to motivate users to share anonymized, preprocessed log
files in order to help us improve our systems.

    <sect>Installation
      <p>
Caveat: THIS PROGRAM NEEDS MORE PREREQUISITES THAN OTHER GNU
PACKAGES. However, otherwise the install procedure is
GNU conformant. 
</p><p>
Please tell us about any bugs in the installation procedure.
</p>
      <p>The current distribution typically runs GNU/Linux 
	machines of diverse flavours.
</p>
      <p>Get installed: you have received the package gift-0.1.x.tgz. Now:
<itemize>
	  <item><bf>New:</bf> we have added a Perl script which tries
to fetch the perl prerequisites, as well as SnakeCharmer. It uses the
CPAN (comprensive Perl archive network) module for installing. This
module might ask you plenty of questions.</item>
	  <item>For successful installing and running we need<itemize>
	      <item> a recent g++ (we suggest 3.3, we need definitely younger than gcc 2.8)  </item>
	      <item>Image Magick (the feature extraction uses it to
convert image formats to PPM files.)</item>
	      <item>Perl younger than 5.003 (you get that at 
www.cpan.org)</item>
	      <item>Currently we use the Perl modules
<itemize>
		  <item>Parse-Yapp-1.05</item>
		  <item>XML-Parser-2.34</item>
		  <item>libxml-perl-0.07</item>
		  <item>XML-RegExp-0.03</item>
		  <item>XML-SAX-0.12</item>
		  <item>XML-Writer-0.4</item>
		  <item>XML-Handler-EasyTree-Traversal</item>
		  <item>XML-Handler-Trees-0.02</item>
		  <item>XML-DOM-1.43</item>
		  <item>XML-XQL-0.68</item>
		  <item>Text-Iconv-1.2</item>
		  <item>libnet (if not already provided by your GNU/Linux distribution)</item>
		  <item>libwww (if not already provided by your GNU/Linux distribution)</item>
		</itemize>
		<p><em>If this is too much for you to handle, please ask for the gift 
		    prerequisites package and help us develop and test it. <url url="mailto:help-gift@gnu.org"> is a good place to discuss this
		  </em></p>
</item>
	      <item>doxygen (optional, for system documentation)</item>
	    </itemize>
</item>	  
<item>Unpack it by doing <code>tar -xzvf gift-VERSION.tgz</code>
</item>
	  <item>Follow the install instructions in the file
<code>INSTALL</code>
The configuration script provides the following options:<itemize>
	      <item><tt>--enable-interactive</tt> this enables an
interactive script that installs the prerequisites at some default
locations. It makes use of the Perl CPAN module. You should have a man
page about that on your system.</item>
	      <item><tt>--enable-multi-threading</tt> enables
multithreading. If this option is enabled, the
<tt>configure</tt>script checks automatically, if it <em>can</em> use
multithreading. If this is the case, the script will enable
multithreading support. Currently this is less stable than I would
like it to be. However, on multiprocessor machines a very interesting
option, as query processing will be distributed over the processors.</item>
	      
	    </itemize>
          
</item>
	  <item>If you have installed doxygen,  
You can now look at the system documentation by typing 
<code>lynx Doc/autoDoc/HTML/hier.html</code>.
</item>
	  <item>Unpack now the charmer archive: <code>tar -xvf
Charmer-0.2.tar</code></item>
	  <item>Run the configuration script <code>cd Charmer-0.2;perl write-applet-frame.pl</code></item>
	</itemize>
</p>
    </sect>
    <sect>
      <heading>Prepare and run the server</heading>
      <p>
We assume that you have successfully installed GIFT. Now you want
to start the server, I suppose. But first you have to give to GIFT an 
image collection. 
</p>
      <sect1>
	<heading>$GIFT_HOME: where the configuration data goes</heading>
      <p>
By default, the indexing data of the collections, as well as the
configuration files reside in your home directory. 
</p><p>
To change this default, set the environment variable 
GIFT_HOME the to absolute path of the directory where you want
your gift-indexing-data etc. to reside and put the line:
</p>
      <code>export GIFT_HOME=/absolute/path/to/my_gift_home</code>
      <p>into your .bashrc</p>
      <p>
Now you are ready to index a collection.
</p>
      </sect1>
      <sect1>
	<heading>Indexing a collection</heading>
	<p>
The vanilla way of indexing a collection is by typing
<code>gift-add-collection.pl /absolute/name/of/a/directory/tree/containing/images/</code>. 
This script will then create the appropriate configuration files and index directories
in your home directory (or in $GIFT_HOME). Please note that it should be possible to
index all images within your home directory tree by typing

<code>gift-add-collection.pl ~</code>. 

	<p>
The script, as it is now
takes 20-30 seconds per image to create the base indexing data for 
inverted file creation. The inverted file creation itself will take about
5 minutes to about an hour, depending on the size of the collection. The biggest
collections we have indexed so far are 13000 images. This took our fast server 
two days. 500 images get indexed on my portable AMD-K6-2-based
computer in less than 3 hours. 
</p>
	<sect2>
	  <heading>Indexing in multiple runs</heading>
	  <p>If you have to index a large collection or if you are
indexing your collection on a portable computer, indexing a collection
in one run becomes inacceptable. If you stop the
<code>gift-add-collection.pl</code> 
during feature generation and
indexing, you can resume by simply restarting the program. On restart,
it will check each file if it was correctly generated and resume
operation at the first file which was not correctly generated.</p>
	  </sect2>
	<sect2>
	  <heading>Handling files in public_html</heading>
	  <p>Most web server configurations have for each user a
directory which is published on the web (if the file permissions are set
accordingly). On most systems this directory is ~/public_html,
and the associated URL is http://localhost/~your_username/
. gift-add-collection.pl takes these settings into account. If an
image file <verb>~/public_html/a_file</verb>are encountered,
gift-add-collection.pl will generate a
<verb>http://localhost/~your_username/a_file</verb>url. for files
which are elsewhere, urls of the kind 
<verb>file:/a/path/another_file</verb> 
will be generated. If you are
not happy with the settings, we suggest you to run 
<code>gift-add-collection.pl --help</code> 
and to read the "Digging in the indexing files" section of this document.
</p>
	  </sect2>
      </sect1>
      
	<p>When the indexing is done, you can start the GIFT server:
      <code>gift</code>.
At the time of writing, gift will output tons of debugging output on
the screen. Most of the time it also will tell you why it dies, if it
dies. In the cases known to me, reasons for dying are usually
inappropriate config file locations, as well as the untrapped
possibilty to nuke the server using faulty XML or a non-exsistent
session ID.
</p>
	<p>
      It will start up, and it will listen on
      the socket 12789 for connecting clients.
</p>
      <p>While 12789 is the port number by default, you can override
this default port number by giving it as the first parameter. In
addition to that you can override GIFT_HOME by giving it as parameter
to the GIFT, for example:
<code>gift 12888 /usr/local/share/shared-gift-collections/</code>
</p>
    </sect>
    <sect>
      <heading>Getting started with the Charmer interface</heading>
      <p><itemize>
	  <item>
The installation is not yet GNU-ish: Simply unpack the archive and do:
<code>cd Charmer-0.2;perl write-applet-frame.pl</code>
</item>
	  <item>Start the Charmer interface by typing 
<code>cd Charmer-0.2;appletviewer Charmer.html</code>

Note that you <em>have</em> to cd into the directory where Charmer
resides. Otherwise you would have to play with CLASSPATHs.
</item>
	  
	  <item>Click on the button which symbolizes a handshake. 
</item>
	  <item>Fill in the request: In the first line you give the
 host and the port, separated by a colon (e.g. localhost:12789). In
the second line you give a username. This serves for opening a session
under your name. We plan to add persistent user management to gift, to
make it possible for the user to choose between different sessions.
</item>
	  <item>As a reaction to pressing OK in the request, the
interface changes: It now gives you a choice between different
algorithms and collections. In this case all the algorithms are
weighting functions for ranked queries on inverted files. However,
in principle, you can put anything there.</item>
	  <item>Click the dice symbol. You will get a random selection
of images from the collection you chose.
</item>
	  <item>You now have the possibility to click on one or
multiple of these images (they will get a green frame when clicked), 
and send a query for them by clicking on the <em>binoculars</em> 
button.</item>
</item>
	  <item>Getting back your query result, you are able to
improve it. You can either click on some of the query results (thus
adding "positive" images to your query) or click the right mouse
button on an image and use the menu that pops up to indicate that you
want to exclude them from further consideration.</item>
	  <item>To clear your query, press the button with the curved
arrow, this deletes yur query, but does not clear the display of the
result set.</item>
	</itemize>

      <heading>Troubleshooting</heading>
      <sect1>
	<heading>No connection</heading>
	<p>
	On connecting to a remote server, you do not get the choice
	between different algorithms (and at least one collection).
</p>
	<p>
	  Be aware, that an applet can only connect to the server it
	  came from. So you have to see to it that your appletviewer
	  fetches the SnakeCharmer applet from the remote server. 
	</p>
      </sect1>
      <sect1>
	<heading>Instead of images, I see empty frames</heading>
	<p>There are several possible reasons for this</p>
	<sect2>
	  <heading>Wrong image file format</heading>
	  <p>For generality, we allow quite a number of image formats:
files with the extension png, gif, jpg, jpeg, eps, and ppm.
	  unfortunately JAVA is only able to digest GIF and JPEG. 
	  </p>
	  <p>Problems have been reported with recent JREs and SnakeCharmer.
	    These were due to security problems (below).
	</sect2>
	<sect2>
	  <heading>JAVA security gets in our way</heading>
	  <p>JAVA 1.1.x and JAVA 1.2 have different security
concepts. While in JAVA 1.1.x the appletviewer does not load any
remote IDs (at least I had once trouble with that), JAVA 1.2's
appletviewer is extremely restrictive, as restrictive as a browser
would be. As a consequence, you have to put your images and thumbnails
into a web-published area, if you want to see anything.
</p>
	  <p>
	    See the "digging in the indexing files" section for more information
	  </p>
	</sect2>
	<sect2>
	  <heading>JAVA 1.4-1.5 security</heading>
	  <p>Problems have been reported on <url url="mailto:help-gift@gnu.org"> which were due 
	    to bad installations of JAVA. Please make sure that the security policies of
	    the JRE are accessible to the appletviewer. Ample documentation about 
	    security policy files can be found at SUN's site.

      <sect1>
	<heading>Digging in the indexing files</heading>
	<sect2>
	  <heading>url2fts.xml</heading>
	  <p>
MRML is based on URLs. Based on the url, it will see if it knows
already the image, if the image is in the indexed collection etc. . If
the image is unknown, it will create new features for finding a
corresponding image etc. . As a consequence, if you move images that
have been indexed from one directory to another, you will have to
change the translation table from url to feature file. This resides in
the "url2fts.xml" files.
</p>
	  <sect3>
	    <heading>Where is the url2fts.xml for a given collection?</heading>
	    <p>Assuming you have a collection containing images from
<code>/this/is/a/path/to/my_collection/</code>
You will find the indexing data in the directory 
<code>${VIPER_HOME:-$HOME}/gift-indexing-data/my_collection/</code>
The translation table from URL to feature file resides in 
<code>${VIPER_HOME:-$HOME}/gift-indexing-data/my_collection/url2fts.xml</code>
</p></sect3>
	  <sect3>
	    <heading>Modifying url2fts.xml for moving a collection</heading>
	    <p>Do <code>emacs \
${VIPER_HOME:-$HOME}/gift-indexing-data/my_collection/url2fts.xml</code>
What you get to see is a long table of the structure

<verb>
  &lt;image url-postfix="IMAGEURL" thumbnail-url-postfix="THUMBNAILURL" feature-file-name="NAME_OF_THE_FEATURE_FILE" /&gt;
</verb>

Clearly, if you move the images from one location to another, you have
to adjust image_location and thumbnail_location. Usually this amounts
to a simple query-replace operation.
</p>
	    <p>For example: at my place I have the collection TSR500,
and the first line looks like this: <verb>&lt;image url-postfix="http://localhost/~muellerw/images/TSR500/b_1002_scaled_small.jpg" thumbnail-url-postfix="http://localhost/~muellerw/images/TSR500_thumbnails/b_1002_scaled_small_thumbnail_jpg.jpg" feature-file-name="/home/muellerw/gift-indexing-data/TSR500/b_1002_scaled_small_jpg.fts" /&gt;
</verb>
If I want to move this collection from 
<verb>~muellerw/public_html/TSR500/</verb> 
to
<verb>~muellerw/public_html/TSR501/</verb>
all I have to do is to replace each string 
<verb>images/TSR500</verb>
by
<verb>images/TSR501</verb>
in urls2fts (and to restart the GIFT, of course).
</p>
	  </sect3>
	  <sect3>
	    <heading>JAVA: file:/... URLs vs. http://.. URLs</heading>
	    <p>In my humble experience, old (1.1.x) appletviewers had
problems with http:// URLs. "Problems" means, that they simply were
neither downloaded nor displayed. "Uncool", in a word. The opposite now
happens with a recent (1.2) appletviewer. The images are shown, if
they come by http from a location on the local host, they will not be
shown, if they are specified by a file:/... URL. This renders giving 
defaults which work for everybody impossible. We give possibilites to specify
all this in gift-add-collection.pl (try --help for viewing the
options). However, if you are experiencing trouble you can simply
do replacement of URLs in the url2fts.xml file, as described in the
section above.

      <heading>How to analyze GIFT</heading>
      <p> In any case, if you are interested in adding anything to the
GIFT, we would be happy to hear from you. Please mail the maintainer,
Wolfgang M&uuml;ller: Wolfgang.Mueller@cui.unige.ch . He will be happy
to help.
      <p>
We use doxygen as a system documentation tool. This
means we put JAVADoc like comments into the headers.
If you want to find out, what the different classes are doing
we suggest you to run doxygen on libInvertedFile/include/*.h and
just browse. Comments in the *.cc files are usually shorter
and only geared towards implementation. Later we plan to include
a script which synchronizes comments between the headers and the
prototypes in the *.cc files.
</p>
      <p>
For the developer there are several alternatives:
<enum>
	  <item> use as much code as possible
   Then inherit something from CAccessor (access to
   a given indexation method and database) and/or
   CQuery (using this method to actually process queries).
   It would be useful then to understand how CSessionManager works.
   If you have suggestions to change what we have, please notify us and 
   help us release. We are currently improving the factory design for
   accessors. This should make enhancing GIFT much easier.
</item>
	  <item>
Intermediate: use the parsing code, but not much more. The knowledge
   about MRML is in the ...handler functions in CSessionManager and
   CCommunicationHandler/Server. This might serve as an inspiration. 
</item>
	  <item>
   As little code as possible: Simply take the DTD. If you make a server,
   try, if 
<code>gift-mrml-client.pl</code> 
works with your system. Try to 
   make it work seamlessly with an unmodified version of the charmer interface.
</item>
	</enum>
Always: patches are welcome. If you are missing MRML functionality, we 
would be also very interested in providing this functionality or
helping you in providing it yourself. Please contact the maintainer of
GIFT/Charmer as named in the AUTHORS file.
</p>
<p>
We are currently putting together some documentation which will include
a "gift extension howto". This is going hand in hand with some redesign
of the session manager, in order to make cooperation easier.

	<heading>Call for participation</heading>
	<p>
      It is obvious that a group of three people cannot attack all
this. However, we are hoping for help both from users and
scientists. While users probably will be most interested in treating
as many file types as possible, scientists may profit from enhancing the 
capabilities of MRML as well as a persistent session management, which 
would permit learning about each user and thus improve query
performance.
