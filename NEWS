0.1.9   more bugfixes. Internationalization is on the way, there should
	be no problem any more regaring umlauts in files that are indexed.
	
	We kicked out the expat from the current release, so you have to
	have one preinstalled to run the GIFT. The perl parts need now
	the modules XML::XQL and Text::Iconv. Check out the 
	gift-install-prerequisites.pl script if you have more questions.

	WARNING: Not yet BSD ready.

0.1.8   fixed some bugs with the make dist target. Same as last version,
	but *should* compile now without any tweaking on 
	gcc v3.0.2 (and hopefully later?) and gcc v2.95.

0.1.7   some exception cleanup, some steps towards user authentification
	(server using multiple sockets).

0.1.6pre4
	cleaning up the cvs, making make dist work for more easily
	making more frequent releases

...     mainly bug fixes, including some very very hard to find
	trouble in memory allocation when multithreading

0.1.5	Plugin support.

	Multithreading support, 
	try ./configure --enable-multi-threading <other options>

0.1.4	improvement of Perl query engine

0.1.3	first "preliminarily GNUed version for the FSF"
