/** 

    FIXME: The name WRONGLY suggests that this actually does parallel
    processing. It should be relatively quick to add, it is intendend,
    but it is not yet done.

    This is going to be one of our main building blocks.
    It is a structure which contains a couple of 
    CQuery structures, hands a query through to them,
    and then unifies the result. In fact this is the center of 
    all this query tree business.

    Probably we will put another layer into the class tree:
    The CQTreeNode, but let's first start.

    Important: The basic assumption here is, that all children 
    operate on the same collections. If this is not the case we 
    have to be more careful, and most of all: we have to operate using
    URLs.
