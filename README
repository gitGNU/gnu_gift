  IF YOU'RE ALLREADY RUNNING AN INSTALLATION OF A PREVIOUS
  VERSION OF THE GIFT, PLEASE DO READ THE "NEWS" FILE.

  The GIFT is a content based image retrieval system.
  That is, it enables the user to retrieve images from a collection 
  without attaching text-based annotation to each image.

  For a no-problem-few-questions interactive installation (the method
  tested best) that does not use CPAN get gift-prerequisites-0.11.tar.gz 
  and install that. Then type:

  % ./configure  --enable-multithreading
  % make
  % make install


  For a few-questions interactive installation that 
  uses CPAN type (a bit more risky than the previous approach
  not due to CPAN, but more difficult to test).

  % ./configure --enable-interactive --enable-multithreading
  % make
  % make install


  If you ask yourself questions, read :
