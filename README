  The GIFT is a content based image retrieval system.
  That is, it enables the user to retrieve images from a collection 
  without attaching text-based annotation to each image.

  For a no-problem-few-questions interactive installation type

  % ./configure --enable-interactive --enable-multithreading
  % make
  % make install

  If you ask yourself questions, read :
